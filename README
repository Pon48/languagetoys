Currently here: a Markov random sonnet generator. There's sample
output at http://darius.livejournal.com/47444.html
(The program does somewhat better now than what's shown off there.)
To generate it:
$ python verse.py sonnet  # or other verse form it knows about

Currently missing: the data it works from. You need two files:

* 2gm-common6: lines like "word1 word2\tcount" for common bigrams
  (word1 can be "<S>" for start of sentence)
* cmudict.0.7a: from http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict

I'd like to add I don't normally publish code in such a crap state.
